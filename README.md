mpShell - Matthew Pfister's Shell
=================================


Run instructions
-----------------
 1. run make
 2. run ./mpShell

commands
--------
 >mpShell works the same as the UNIX shell:
  	All UNIX shell commands work, such as: ls, pwd, ps and so forth.

	Pipelining works the same as well, 
		i.e. cat makefile | grep c | grep g
			who | wc -l

		Redirecting works the same as well, 
			i.e. ls > test
			cat < test
